# API

The API is one way to keep cached features up-to-date on your servers.

With the **API**, your servers pull feature definitions from GrowthBook in a cronjob (or similar).

With [Webhooks](/app/webhooks), GrowthBook calls out to your servers as soon as features change in GrowthBook.

## Environments and API Keys

When you first start setting up features in GrowthBook, we create a "production" environment for you with an API key.

You can add new environments by going to **Settings -> Environments**.

## Official SDKs

We offer official SDKs that work with these data structures in a few popular languages with more coming soon.
