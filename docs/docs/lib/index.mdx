# SDKs

We offer official SDKs in a few popular languages:

- [Javascript/Typescript](/lib/js)
- [React](/lib/react)
- [PHP](/lib/php)
- [Ruby](/lib/ruby)
- [Python](/lib/python)
- [Go](/lib/go)
- [Java](/lib/java)
- [C#](/lib/csharp)
- [Kotlin (Android)](/lib/kotlin)
- [Swift](/lib/swift)
- [Flutter](/lib/flutter)

There is also a guide if you want to [build your own](/lib/build-your-own).

It's not required to use any of these libraries. The only requirement is that you track in your datasource when users are put into an experiment and which variation they received.

## Feature Support Matrix

GrowthBook is constantly releasing new functionality. The table below can help figure out which SDK versions are required for the features you are utilizing in GrowthBook.

| Feature                       | JS     | React  | PHP   | Ruby  | Python | Go    | Java  | C#    | Kotlin | Swift  | Flutter |

| Variation names               | 0.23.0 | 0.12.0 | 1.2.0 | 1.0.0 | 1.0.0  | -     | 0.6.0 | -     | -      | -      | -       |
| Version string comparisons    | 0.27.0 | 0.17.0 | -     | -     | -      | -     | 0.7.0 | -     | 1.1.31 | 1.0.38 | -       |

Below is a more detailed description of each feature:

- **Feature flags and experiments** - Basic support for feature flags and experiments - evaluating targeting conditions against supplied user attributes, assigning experiment variations, firing a tracking callback, etc.
- **Built-in fetching and caching** - The ability to pass in an `apiHost` and `clientKey` to the SDK and features/experiments will be fetched and cached automatically using best practices.
- **Encrypted features** - The ability to provide a `decryptionKey` to decrypt SDK payloads when encrpytion is enabled within GrowthBook
- **Unbiased hashing (hash v2)** - An improved hashing algorithm to eliminate bias when assigning experiment variations (e.g. being in variation A in one test will not influence which variation you get in another test)
- **Variation names** - Making variation names (as well as ids) available in your `trackingCallback` function
- **Version string comparisons** - Ability to use version string targeting attributes with proper comparison logic (e.g. greater than / less than)
